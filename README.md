# Chronic-Disease-Data-Analysis-Using-Python-and-Machine-Learning

This project explores the prevalence of chronic diseases and their relationship with demographic variables based on data collected in Bucaramanga, Santander, over a period of nearly two years. Using exploratory data analysis techniques and machine learning models, relevant patterns in the distribution of diseases were identified, and predictive models were developed to anticipate the presence of certain chronic conditions based on factors such as age, gender, and location.

The analysis provided key insights to support public health strategies and foster a deeper understanding of the behavior of chronic diseases at the local level.
